__Knights of the Vale__

The king of the valley is dead, and has left no clear heir. Rather than directly enter a state of civil war, the royal council has decided to hold a contest in which the barons will compete to see who is most fit to rule. Through manipulation and might, show your rivals that you are the rightful new king.

Knights of the Vale is a new game originally conceived by Steve Soule and devloped by R. Ryan Driskel. It is a heavy strategy game in a similar spirit to Eclipse.

Points shall be assigned for amassing well-trained troops to defend the country, for constructing great civic buildings for the good of the land and for arranging political alliances with important residents of the land.  The baron with the most points at the end of the contest will be crowned king of the valley.
